# uber-eda-project
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis of Uber ride requests to uncover demand patterns, trip issues, and optimize service efficiency.

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride request data to identify operational bottlenecks such as high cancellation rates and unavailability of cars. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques, we examined how time and pickup location influence trip outcomes and built an Excel dashboard for interactive visualization.

---
## 📊 Key Objectives

- Understand the distribution of trip statuses (Completed, Cancelled, No Cars Available)
- Identify peak request hours and critical demand windows
- Analyze pickup point behavior (City vs Airport)
- Build an interactive dashboard for visual storytelling
- Recommend operational improvements based on findings

---
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Excel:** Dashboard creation and visual summaries
- **SQL:** Additional querying for insights
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis

---
## 🔍 Summary of Insights
- Evening peak hours at the Airport show the highest number of "No Cars Available"
- Morning City pickups have a high cancellation rate
- Request Hour and Drop Hour are strongly correlated, indicating predictable trip durations
- Pickup point and time influence the likelihood of trip failure

---
## ✅ Business Impact
- These insights can help Uber:
- Optimize driver supply during peak hours
- Reduce cancellations and unavailability
- Improve customer satisfaction through better service planning
